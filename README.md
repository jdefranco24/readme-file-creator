# Readme File Creator


## Description

I was tasked with creating an automated readme through the process of node. When prompted the terminal will ask a series of questions where you fill in the blanks. The questions are template questions to help fill in the necessary information required in a readme. The information provides details so outsiders can understand the application. This is a working template and speeds efficiency of projects.
